# DealNest Partner Request & Chat API

A comprehensive FastAPI application that implements partner request workflow and real-time chat functionality for DealNest. Users can send partner requests to connect with other users, engage in real-time chat with presence tracking, and receive read receipts.

## Features

### Partner Request System
- **User Management**: Create and manage users with email and name
- **Partner Requests**: Send, receive, and respond to partner requests
- **Partnership Creation**: Automatic partnership creation when requests are accepted
- **Email Notifications**: Mock email notifications for request events

### Real-Time Chat System
- **Chat Channels**: Create channels with multiple users
- **Real-Time Messaging**: WebSocket-based instant messaging
- **Presence Tracking**: See who's online/offline with last seen timestamps
- **Read Receipts**: Know when messages have been read
- **WebSocket Events**: Real-time presence changes and message notifications

### Technical Features
- **SQLite Database**: Simple SQLite database for data persistence
- **Redis Support**: Optional Redis for presence storage (falls back to in-memory)
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 24 tests covering all functionality
- **Auto Documentation**: Interactive API docs at `/docs`

# Mark message as read
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8004/chat/messages/1/mark-read/"

# Check user presence
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8004/chat/presence/1/"
```

## Database

The application uses SQLite with the following tables:

### Core Tables
- **users**: User information (id, email, name, created_at)
- **partner_requests**: Partner requests (id, sender_id, recipient_id, status, created_at)
- **partnerships**: Created partnerships (id, user_a_id, user_b_id, created_at)

### Chat Tables
- **chat_channels**: Chat channels (id, name, created_at)
- **channel_members**: Many-to-many relationship between channels and users
- **messages**: Chat messages (id, sender_id, channel_id, body, is_read, created_at)

The database file (`dealnest.db`) is created automatically when the application starts.

## Environment Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration. A `.env.example` file is provided as a template:

```bash
# Application Settings
APP_ENV=development
APP_PORT=8004
LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./dealnest.db

# Email Configuration (for future production use)
EMAIL_SERVICE_URL=
EMAIL_API_KEY=
EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@dealnest.com

# Redis Configuration (for future caching)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Security (for future authentication)
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here-change-in-production
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
JWT_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and modify the values as needed for your environment.

## Frontend Demo

A complete HTML/JavaScript demo is included to showcase the real-time chat functionality:

1. **Start the API server**:
   ```bash
   poetry run python -m app.main
   ```

2. **Open the demo**: Open `static/chat_demo.html` in your browser

3. **Features demonstrated**:
   - Connect as different users via WebSocket
   - Create and join chat channels
   - Send real-time messages
   - See presence status (online/offline)
   - Receive read receipts
   - View event logs for debugging

The demo includes a modern UI with connection status, message history, presence indicators, and real-time event logging.

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/ -v
```

The tests cover:
- User creation and retrieval
- Partner request creation and validation
- Request acceptance and rejection
- Chat channel creation and management
- Real-time messaging functionality
- Presence tracking
- Read receipts
- Error handling for duplicate requests and invalid actions

## Email Notifications

The application includes a mock email notification system that logs notifications to the console. When:

- A partner request is created: Recipient receives notification
- A partner request is accepted: Sender receives notification

Example notification log:
```
ðŸ“§ EMAIL NOTIFICATION: To: Bob
ðŸ“§ EMAIL NOTIFICATION: Subject: New Partner Request
ðŸ“§ EMAIL NOTIFICATION: Body: You have a new partner request from Alice.
ðŸ“§ EMAIL NOTIFICATION: Timestamp: 2024-01-15 10:30:00
ðŸ“§ EMAIL NOTIFICATION: Status: Sent (mocked)
```

## Design Decisions

### Models and Relationships
- **User Model**: Simple stub with id, email, name, and created_at timestamp
- **PartnerRequest Model**: Links sender and recipient with status tracking
- **Partnership Model**: Created when requests are accepted, represents the partnership relationship

### Status Transitions
- Partner requests start as "pending"
- Can transition to "accepted" or "rejected"
- Once responded to, status cannot be changed again

### Notifications
- Mock email service logs notifications to console
- Notifications sent for request creation and acceptance
- Easy to replace with real email service in production

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive validation for all endpoints
- Prevents duplicate requests between same users
- Prevents self-requests
- Validates user existence before operations

## Scaling Considerations

For handling thousands of requests per second, consider:

1. **Database Optimization**:
   - Use PostgreSQL or MySQL instead of SQLite
   - Add database indexes on frequently queried fields
   - Implement connection pooling

2. **Caching**:
   - Cache user data and request statuses
   - Use Redis for session management

3. **Background Processing**:
   - Move email notifications to background queues (Celery/RQ)
   - Use message brokers for async processing

4. **API Optimization**:
   - Implement pagination for large result sets
   - Add rate limiting
   - Use async/await throughout the application

5. **Monitoring**:
   - Add application metrics and monitoring
   - Implement health checks and alerting
   - Use structured logging

## Health Check

The application includes a health check endpoint:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8004/health"
```

This returns `{"status": "ok"}` when the application is running properly.
